# Nand to Tetris
This repository is to store my solutions for the Nand To Tetris course., taken on Coursera (https://www.nand2tetris.org/course)
The course encompasses building a computer from the ground up from hardware to software, starting with a Nand gate.

## Project 1: Boolean Logic
Build the following chips using Hardware Description Language (HDL):
* Nand
* Not
* And
* Or
* Xor
* Mux
* DMux
* Not16
* And16
* Or16
* Mux16
* Or8Way
* Mux4Way16
* Mux8Way16
* DMux4Way
* DMux8Way

## Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
Build the following chips using Hardware Description Language (HDL):
* Half Adder
* Full Adder
* Add16
* Inc16
* Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

## Project 3: Sequential Logic
Build the following chips using Hardware Description Language (HDL):
* Bit (1-bit register)
* Register (16-bit register)
* RAM8 (16-bit / 8-register memory)
* RAM64
* RAM512
* RAM4K
* RAM16K
* Program Counter (PC)

## Project 4: Machine Language
Write two programs in Hack assembly language:
* Mult.asm (multiplies two numbers and stores the output)
* Fill.asm (handles I/O via screen and keyboard devices - infinite loop that listens to keyboard input and fills the screen when a key is pressed)

## Project 5: Computer Architecture
Build the following chips using Hardware Description Language (HDL) to complete the construction of the Hack hardware platform:
* Memory
* Central Processing Unit (CPU)
* Computer

## Project 6: The Assembler
Write an assembler program that translates programs in the Hack assembly language into machine code that can execute on the Hack hardware platform built in the previous projects. 
The assembler should successfully translate the four programs into .hack files:
* Add.asm
* Max.asm
* Rect.asm
* Pong.asm

## Projects 7 - 12 
To be completed.
